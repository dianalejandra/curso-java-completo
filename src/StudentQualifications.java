/*
Request 20 final grades from students on a scale of 1 to 7, handling decimals in the grades (double). Show the average of grades greater than 5, average of grades below 4, and the number of grades that are 1, as well as the total average.

Help: use a for loop that iterates up to 20 (grades) and within the loop ask for the grades one by one to perform calculations (counters, sums).

Optional: if one of the entered grades is 0, the for loop should exit, and display an error message ending the program.*/
